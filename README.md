# Tests - Administration

This repository contains the procedure guide (this file) and will contain in the future any administrative files required by the procedure.

## General Procedure

The table below illustrates the BM, candidate, and DT activities within the procedure.

| BM | Candidate | DT |
|----|-----------|----|
| 1. BM asks the candidate to send his/her GitHub username | | |
| | 2. Candidate creates the account (if neeeded) and sends the username to the BM | |
| 3. BM prepares a repository for the candidate and adds candidate as collaborator | | |
| | 4. Candidate accesses repository and executes the test as described in the guide | |
| | 5. Candidate notifies BM once the exercise is finished and code pushed to the repository | |
| 6. BM notifies DT that test is ready for evaluation | | |
| | | 7. DT evaluates test and reports evaluation to BM |
| 8. BM integrates technical evaluation on the final decision | | |

### 1. [BM] Asking candidate to send his/her GitHub username

This step can be executed by any preferred communication channel. The important message to be transmitted is that:
 - The exercise is all based on a GitHub repository, and for that reason we need to add the candidate as contributor
 - We need the username associated to an email that the candidate has access to, as the invite will be sent to this associated email.
 
### 2. [Candidate] Provide a GitHub username to the BM

The candidate will reply to the BM request with his/her GitHub username. Once the BM has this information, the candidate repository can be prepared.

### 3. [BM] Preparing a repository for the candidate

1. Visit the [GitHub account home](https://github.com/techtests-be) - you will need to login (credentials shared ad-hoc)
2. Create a new repository by going to Repositories then New (as shown below)

3. Edit the repository details:
 a. Repository name should be of the format test-<lang>-<first_name>-<last_name> (e.g. test-java-francisco-pires)
 b. Make sure the repository is set to private

At the end of this step, you should see the following default page on the newly created repository:
